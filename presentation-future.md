# Looking into the future

Roadmap ‚Ä¢ Wishlist ‚Ä¢ Ideas

---

## v3.3

- **Privacy features** <small>Part 2</small>
  - Yep, we still love GDPR <small>(...and CERN's own GDPR aka "OC-11")</small>
  - User-accessible dump (JSON?) of everything they are linked to 
  - User consent for privacy notice during registration
  - Admin tool to anonymize an account (deletion not always feasible)
- Receipt/certificate generation
  - Fully customizable templates for PDF generation

---

## v3.4

- **Rewrite conference timetable** & timetable management in React
  - Rare cases will take the most time... e.g. heavily parallel conferences
  - Maybe **refresh conference layout** to have more horizontal space?
- Remove most (all?) ultra-legacy JS (from before jQuery)
  - Opens the door for improving our asset building/bundling pipeline

---

## vX.Y - "Wishlist" üå†

- **User-focused home page** üßë
  - More dashboard-like
  - Take user's favorites ‚≠ê into account
- **UX/UI improvements**
  - More consistency
  - Accessibility üë®‚Äçü¶Ø
  - Material editor: Drag & Drop
  - Better support for small screens üì±
- **Modern API**
  - Legacy ("classic") API is from 2011 and feels that way
  - API keys already deprecated in favor of Bearer tokens
  - Granular scopes? Versioned endpoints? OpenAPI specs?
  - Modify/create things via API as well?

## Does our versioning (still) make sense?

- v1 to v2: ZODB -> Postgres, **nearly full rewrite**
- v2 to v3: Python 2 -> Python 3, **great for devs & future-proof**
- v3 to v4: ???

"Minor" releases are actually major features & often DB changes
"Patch" releases are normal releases with features and bugfixes

---

### Ditch one version digit?

- All the major web browser vendors do it
  - But they also have a pretty static release cadence (~monthly)
  - 111.0, 111.1, 111.2, 112.0, 113.0, ...
  - Are "minor" releases supposed to include (small) features?
- We do not need a bugfix-only branch
  - Limits dev flexibility & adds overhead (branch switching & merging)
  - Almost continuous deployment (at CERN); small features are not held back for weeks

---

### How it could look like for us

- v3.3 becomes v4.0 instead (and v3.4 would be v5.0)
- Once v4.0 is released, that branch will become v4.1-dev for bugfixes and smaller "straight to prod" features
- Heavy new development would then target v5.0

    margin-top: 2rem;
  }
</style>

### But is it really worth it?

- It's just a number!
- Nobody expects *semver* outside libraries
  - API versioning is a completely different topic!
  - We never got complaints about our versioning/release schema

üß† If you have any thoughts or opinions on this topic let me know!
